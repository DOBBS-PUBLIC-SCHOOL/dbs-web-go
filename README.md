# dbs-web-go
 It is the repository which www.dobbsschool.com/go?{command} completely depends on
# go?
  go? is a basic application idea that help to access many web pages,web application,etc. on a single webpage with a query command
  www.dobbsschool.com/go?settings will allow the admin/student-wesite-committee to have direct and complete access to the particular page (go) on the web server
# Problem solved by go
  Students who need to implement an idea on the school website cant get direct access to the hosting server for security reasons.
  By using go, a particular page (go) on the sever is directly accessed by the school's website committee to write/delete media or even create new web-pages and web-application projects by students and teachers
  
## Everything on go is controlled by go?settings
